# For HPCA2021 Review

Refraser-aware Scheduling tool

## Introduction
* This is a prediction tool to generate the scheduling table for HPCA2021 paper 406.
* This tools will generate a table consists of: the priority and the number of concurrent processes.
* The scheduling table will be read by the OS to adaptively change the priority of Deep Learning Application.
* The overall purpose is to guarantee that Deep Learning Application scheduling does not exceed the safe time-threshold.
* The priority number will be viewed as nice numbers in Linux, within the range of [-20:19]. Lower number means higher priority. ([Ref](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/scheduler/sched-nice-design.html))


## Getting Started

The below instructions will get you a copy of the project up and run it on your local machine for development and testing purpose. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the softwares:
```
+Centos 5.6
+Python >= 2.7
+GCC/G++ 5.0
```

### Compile
Type in the bash command line:

```
./compile.sh
```

### Running the tests

Run [Refraser-awareScheduling.py](Refraser-awareScheduling.py) script

```
python Refraser-awareScheduling.py
```

### Output
[schedule.csv](schedule.csv)        
* The output data with the X-axis/Y-axis are number of concurrent process/process priority of Deep Learning Application
* **Plase note that:** 
  * The provided numbers are the expected finished time of Deep Learning Process
  * The 's'/'t'/'r' characters represent the Safe Zone/Trade-Off Zone/Reloading Zone 

Example:
This is the output [schedule.csv](schedule.csv) with the default priority of concurrent process is 0 and the Deep Learning Processes' priorities are bounded in range [-10:9].

## Running Mode
There are 2 running modes:
* Generate the scheduling table with all the coming processes having the same default priority number. The example is given above.
* Generate the scheduling table with the coming processes having different process priority numbers.

Example for the second mode:
  * We find the safe zone of deep learning processes by input the 10 concurrent processes with their priorities are 1,2,3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,0,1 as described in [process_prio_map.dat](process_prio_map.dat)
  ```
  10
  1,2,3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,0,1
  ```
  * We run the "Refraser-awareScheduling.py" with the option **enable_file_prio_map=1**
  ```
  python Refraser-awareScheduling.py
  ```
  * The output [schedule.csv](schedule.csv):
  ```
   ,-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,
    0,317,375,446,535,647,786,960,1182,1464,1796,2219,2756,3428,4250,5260,6620,8133,10271,12817,16070,
    
    
   ,-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,
   0,s,s,s,t,t,t,t,t,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,r,
  ```
  * It means that the Deep Learning Application can work in the Safe zone with its process priorities are -10 and -9. The priority from -8 to -4 is the trade-off zone.

## How to change the parameters

Modify the "Refraser-awareScheduling.py" file as below

### Usage of key parameters 
* *num_core= < number 0-7 >* :          **Set the CPU configuations:**
  * 0: UNIPROCESSOR
  * 1: DUAL_CPU
  * 2: DUAL_CPU_MC
  * 3: QUAD_CPU
  * 4: QUAD_CPU_MC
  * 5: QUAD_CPU_DUAL_SOCKET
  * 6: QUAD_CPU_QUAD_SOCKET
  * 7: HEX_CPU_DUAL_SOCKET_SMT

* *running_time= < time in ms >* :      **Set the Deep Learning Application running time.**

* *safe_zone= < time in ms >* :        **Set the upperbound constraint of Safe Zone**

* *tradeoff_zone= < time in ms >* :     **Set the upperbound constraint of Trade-Off Zone**

* *default_concurrent_task_prio= < priority number >* :        **Set default priority number of all concurrent tasks if enable_file_prio_map is un-set**

* *enable_file_prio_map= < 0/1 >* :    **Set/un-Set the process's priority from file [process_prio_map.dat](process_prio_map.dat)**
  * [process_prio_map.dat](process_prio_map.dat) format comprises 2 lines:
    - Number of concurrent process
    - Priority number of each concurrent process
